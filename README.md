# DressBook

Just threw your too-clean-to-throw-in-the-laundry-but-a-bit-dirty-for-the-closet 
outfit onto your spare chair? 
Losing track of the ever growing pile of clothes on said chair? 
Can't figure out how to deal with it all?

Well, look no more! DressBook helps you keep track of your outfits and their 
cleanliness status based on 3 colored states. With realtime cloud syncing to
pair, never again worry about that mess on your chair!

DressBook uses Firebase for authentication, database, and cloud storage, so
you can rest assured in confiding your (semi-)messy clothes to us.

Try now by cloning this repo! (coming soon to an App/Play store near you)
